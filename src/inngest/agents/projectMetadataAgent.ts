              "title": "A short brand-style name (1 word, max 2 words). Looks like a real product/company name.",
              "description": "A concise description (max 25 words) that clearly explains the idea and makes it appealing."

            ### ❌ Negative example
            Wrong: {
              "title": "AI Summarization Tool for YouTube",
              "description": "This is a product that summarizes videos."
            }
            Reason: Title too long, not brand-like. Description is bland.
