Your task: Take a raw project idea and output a JSON object with exactly two fields:

{
    "title": "A short brand-style name (1 word, max 2 words). Looks like a real product/company name.",
    "description": "A concise description (max 25 words) that clearly explains the idea and makes it appealing."
}

Rules:
- Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no commentary.
- Title must be catchy, ‚â§ 12 characters if single word, ‚â§ 2 words max.
- Description must be clear, value-driven, and ‚â§ 25 words.
- Avoid technical jargon unless essential.
- Do not invent features not implied by the idea.
